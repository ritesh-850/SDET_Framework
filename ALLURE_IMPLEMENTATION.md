# Allure Reporting Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement Allure reporting in the test automation framework.

## Files Created/Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `conftest.py`: Contains pytest fixtures and hooks for Allure reporting
   - `view_report.bat`: Script to view Allure reports
   - `check_allure.bat`: Script to check if Allure is installed
   - `README.md`: Documentation with instructions on how to use Allure reporting
   - `generate_html_report.bat`: Script to generate standalone HTML reports
   - `ALLURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: This document

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `TEST_CLASS/Test_Login.py`: Updated to use Allure decorators and reporting
   - `TEST_CLASS/Test_Dashboard.py`: Updated to use Allure decorators and reporting
   - `TEST_CLASS/Test_Calender.py`: Updated to use Allure decorators and reporting
   - `run.bat`: Updated to generate Allure reports
   - `install_packages.bat`: Updated to check for Allure installation

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Allure Decorators:**
   - `@allure.epic`: Defines the high-level feature group
   - `@allure.feature`: Defines the feature being tested
   - `@allure.story`: Defines the specific user story
   - `@allure.severity`: Defines the test severity
   - `@allure.description`: Provides a detailed description of the test
   - `@allure.title`: Provides a title for the test

2. **Test Steps:**
   - `with allure.step()`: Defines test steps in the Allure report

3. **Attachments:**
   - `allure.attach()`: Attaches screenshots to the report

4. **Fixtures:**
   - `setup`: Fixture to set up the WebDriver for each test
   - Automatically captures screenshots on test failure

5. **Parametrization:**
   - `@pytest.mark.parametrize`: Demonstrates data-driven testing with Allure

## How to Use

1. **Run Tests with Allure Reporting:**
   ```
   run.bat
   ```

2. **View Allure Report:**
   ```
   view_report.bat
   ```

3. **Generate HTML Report (Alternative):**
   ```
   generate_html_report.bat
   ```

4. **Check Allure Installation:**
   ```
   check_allure.bat
   ```

## Benefits of Allure Reporting

1. **Rich Visualization:**
   - Dashboard with test execution summary
   - Detailed test steps with screenshots
   - Timeline view of test execution

2. **Categorization:**
   - Tests categorized by epic, feature, story, and severity
   - Easy filtering and navigation

3. **Failure Analysis:**
   - Automatic screenshots on test failure
   - Detailed error messages and stack traces

4. **Documentation:**
   - Test descriptions and titles
   - Step-by-step execution details

5. **Data-Driven Testing:**
   - Support for parameterized tests
   - Clear visualization of test data

## Next Steps

1. Update the remaining test files to use Allure reporting
2. Add more detailed assertions and verifications
3. Implement environment information in Allure reports
4. Add custom categories for better organization
5. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
